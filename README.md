# Smart Heart Disease Prediction System

## 🚀 Project Overview
The **Smart Heart Disease Prediction System** is an AI-powered application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on multiple health parameters. It provides detailed disease analysis, doctor consultation suggestions, and personalized health tips to help users maintain a healthy lifestyle.

---

## 🔹 Features

- Predicts the risk of heart disease using machine learning models.
- Provides **detailed disease prediction analysis**.
- Suggests **doctor consultation logic** based on severity.
- Gives **health tips** and lifestyle recommendations.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** 
  - Flask (Web Application)
  - Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
  - Joblib/Pickle (Model Serialization)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database:** Optional (CSV or SQLite)
- **Others:** Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

## ⚡ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sarthak-Nagave/Smart-Heart-Disease-Prediction-System.git
````

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Smart-Heart-Disease-Prediction-System
```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

* Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

* Mac/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

5. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧠 Usage

1. Run the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

3. Enter the required health parameters (e.g., age, blood pressure, cholesterol) and get the prediction.

4. View **detailed disease analysis** and **health tips** based on your input.

## 📈 Model Details

* Uses supervised machine learning models for prediction.
* Model trained on heart disease datasets.
* Evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Model is serialized using `pickle`/`joblib` for deployment.

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements

* Add **voice input/output** for predictions.
* Integrate **real-time health monitoring APIs**.
* Add **multi-language support** (English, Hindi, Marathi).
* Deploy the application to a cloud platform like **Heroku** or **AWS**.
